cmdline_demo
============
These are my notes from a talk I gave a pyladies Boston on July 15th.

The powerpoint the gives an overview of Unix & the command line

Three demos show using commands to get things done:

1. I have a bunch of files with peopleâ€™s email addresses in them. I want a list of all the email addresses in one file.
2. I have a bunch of cards. I want to sort them into folders by suit.
3. That sorting cards thing was a little tedious. Is there a better way?


Cards used in demo 2 and demo 3 are from https://code.google.com/p/vector-playing-cards.
